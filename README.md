## ? About Me

? I am Jainil Rajwaniya, a **Front End Web Developer** (specializing in **React Applications**) & [**freelancer**](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c12e516ee1d35044), who is a **5 star** rated **Rising Talent** on _Upwork_. I am also Pursuing my Bachelors in **Computer Science & Engineering** and will graduate in mid 2022.

??? I enjoy contributing to **Open Source Projects** and am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. In 2020, I learned **Django**, **Electron**, **Flutter**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Firebase**. In 2021, till now, I learned **Next.js**, **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, **GraphQL**, a bit about **Three.js**, and **Vercel**. I got started with [**freelancing**](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c12e516ee1d35044) and [**blogging**](https://dev.to/ruppysuppy) quite recently as well.

? Outside the world of tech too, I love pushing myself to develop new skills ranging from **guitar**, **break dancing (hip-hop)**, **sketching**, **touch typing** to some whacky ones like **writing with my left hand** (only aiming from mastery only in **guitar** and **dancing**).

? I love reading books on **personal development** & **financial literacy**. My favorites ones are **The Compound Effect** by *Darren Hardy* in the genre of personal development and **Rich Dad Poor Dad** by *Robert Kiyosaki* in the genre of financial literacy.

?? I love **traveling** as well, even though it's been some time since I last traveled. My last trip was a solo trip to **Bhutan** in *2018*.
